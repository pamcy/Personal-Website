# Source Code of Pamcy.dev

This is a One-Page Mobile First website I built hosted on GitHub Pages, everything here are `HTML, CSS and JSS`.  

Without the aid of framework, it’s 100% `responsive` based on `Flexbox`. I Stored all my coding challenges as JSON, `retrieve data and display it on the page`, then with [MixItUp](https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/) library for animated filtering of search results. [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) is a great option to integrate contact form into my website, it acts as ‘action’ attribute and forward the form data to my email.
